# Simple Fix for GitHub Upload

## The Problem
Your files didn't actually upload to GitHub due to the token permissions error.

## Quick Fix - Use GitHub CLI (Easiest)

1. **Install GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   brew install gh
   ```

2. **Login to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   gh auth login
   ```
   - Choose "GitHub.com"
   - Choose "HTTPS" 
   - Choose "Login with a web browser"
   - Follow the prompts

3. **Push your files:**
   ```bash
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## Alternative: Manual Upload via Web

If the CLI doesn't work:

1. Go to https://github.com/sweetrobot/password-sync
2. Click the green "Add file" button â†’ "Upload files"
3. Drag ALL your project files into the upload area
4. **IMPORTANT:** Make sure to upload the `.github` folder too!
5. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

## Verify Upload Worked

Go to https://github.com/sweetrobot/password-sync and you should see:
- package.json
- src/ folder
- electron/ folder  
- .github/ folder (this is crucial for the build!)
- All other project files

## Once Files Are Uploaded

1. Go to the "Actions" tab
2. Click "Build Password Sync App" 
3. Click "Run workflow"
4. Wait 5-10 minutes
5. Download your Mac app! ðŸŽ‰

Try the GitHub CLI method first - it handles all the authentication automatically.
