Password Sync App
=================

This package contains the Password Sync application for macOS.

Installation:
1. Open the DMG file
2. Drag the Password Sync app to your Applications folder
3. Open the app from your Applications folder

Usage:
- Upload your Apple and Google password CSV exports
- The app will merge them and allow you to export in both formats
- All processing happens locally on your computer for security

Note: You may need to right-click the app and select "Open" the first time you run it,
since it's not signed with an Apple Developer certificate.
